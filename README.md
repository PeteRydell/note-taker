# note-taker

This application is intended for users to create, save and retrieve notes.

If running on a local machine, the user must first initialize the connection to the server:

Once a connection is secured or if the user is using the hosted web application, they are first presented with a note taker landing page:

After selecting "Get Started" users are directed to a note pad landing page where they can name and then input new notes in the provided input fields:
